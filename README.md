# OpenPrompt


</div>

> This project was created by the CoFFeee team at the [2023 Seoul Web 3.0 Festival](https://www.seoulweb3festival.com/).

OpenPrompt sets new standards for the prompt market. We want to protect creators through Web 3.0 and technology to induce a virtuous cycle structure in the marketplace.



## Use case

![image](https://github.com/SWF2023-CoFFeee/openprompt-client/assets/90181028/65aeb9c8-f0db-4aca-9ed7-74838e08353f)

Creators can register copyrights for their own **Awesome propmts** by minting NFT in our service. Metadata stored in a distributed file system is protected primarily by an encryption algorithm.

Promport, which is registered with our service, is available for 1:1 transactions in the existing NFT market as well as 1:N transactions through ticket sales.

When registering a prompot, it uses a similarity verification algorithm to prevent unauthorized secondary creations.

Through this, we want to overcome the limitations of NFTs as well as the new Promport market ecosystem.
