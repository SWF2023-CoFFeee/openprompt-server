# OpenPrompt


</div>


OpenPrompt sets new standards for the prompt market. We want to protect creators through Web 3.0 and technology to induce a virtuous cycle structure in the marketplace.

## Terminology 

<dl>
  <dt>Prompt</dt>
  <dd>A prompt, in the context of generative AI, refers to the initial input given to the AI model. This input guides the AI's response or output. Prompts can be a single word, a sentence, or even a paragraph, depending on the desired output.
</dd>

 <dt>MetaMask</dt>
  <dd>A software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then interact with Ethereum DApps. In this project, MetaMask is integrated into the user system for account linking and authentication.</dd>

  <dt>Copyright Register</dt>
  <dd>Within the service, when a user registers their prompt, it is encrypted and stored in a distributed file system, and minted as an NFT on the blockchain network. This process ensures the protection of the creator's copyright and allows the registered prompt to be traded within the service.</dd>
  
  <dt>Copyright Trade</dt>
  <dd>Refers to the transfer of ownership of a prompt through NFT transfer. The user who receives the ownership can register the prompt for sale again. This process ensures the rights of the original creator and the new owner, and enables the prompt to be traded within the service.
</dd>

  <dt>Ticket</dt>
  <dd>A ticket buyer receives a key that can decrypt the prompt, allowing them to read the prompt. This process enables transactions beyond 1:1 trades, supporting 1:N trades.</dd>
 
 
<dl>

## Features

- **User System**: Implement a user registration and login system, which includes integration with MetaMask for account linking and authentication.
- **NFT Minting for Copyright Registration**: Enable users to register the copyright of their prompts via NFT minting.
- **Encryption and Decryption in Distributed File System**: Implement encryption and decryption of user's prompts in distributed file system to prevent unauthorized access and leakage.
- **Text Similarity Check for Copyright Protection**: Implement a feature to check the similarity of prompts' texts to prevent unauthorized secondary creations.
- **Prompt Sale Posts (CRUD)**: Implement features for users to create, read, update, and delete prompt sale posts.
- **Market PLP (Product Listing Page) - PDP (Product Detail Page)**: Implement a system that shows product listings and their detailed pages for users to browse and make purchase decisions.
- **Copyright Ownership Inquiry (Get NFT)**: Enable users to check their owned copyright (NFTs).
- **Smart Contract for 1:1 Copyright Trade (Transfer NFT)**: Implement a system for users to trade copyright 1:1 via smart contract.
- **1:N Trading through Ticket Purchase (Transaction)**: Implement a feature for users to conduct 1:N trading of prompts. When a purchase is made (through a transaction), the buyer receives a decryption key which allows them to read the encrypted prompt.


## Usecase

![image](https://github.com/SWF2023-CoFFeee/openprompt-client/assets/90181028/65aeb9c8-f0db-4aca-9ed7-74838e08353f)

Creators can register copyrights for their own **Awesome propmts** by minting NFT in our service. Metadata stored in a distributed file system is protected primarily by an encryption algorithm.

Promport, which is registered with our service, is available for 1:1 transactions in the existing NFT market as well as 1:N transactions through ticket sales.

When registering a prompt, it uses a similarity verification algorithm to prevent unauthorized secondary creations.

Through this, we want to overcome the limitations of NFTs as well as the new Promport market ecosystem.
